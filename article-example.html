        <p>Immediately following Balon Greyjoy’s speech in the Seven’s Union Parliament earlier today, in which he advocated that the Iron Islands should be allowed to vote again and receive a free trade agreement should <i>leave</i> win for good, PM Lannister has categorically refused to have Greyjoy as a partner in post-referendum treating. Lannister has added that he needs an interlocutor who, in his own words, “has a clue of what he’s talking about, and that’s not the case with MP Greyjoy, I am quite afraid”, and that he will not waste any of his precious time talking to clowns who cannot understand that <i>their</i> country is the one suffering most from the results. Greyjoy has issued no answering statement; however, his positions were made extremely clear by his certainly rousing speech, albeit maybe not in the ways he hoped for.</p>
